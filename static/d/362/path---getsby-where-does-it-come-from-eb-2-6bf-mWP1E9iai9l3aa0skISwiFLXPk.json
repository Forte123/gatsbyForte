It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &#8220;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&#8221; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &#8220;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&#8221;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n","featured_media":{"source_url":"http://localhost/getsby/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/september2018.png"},"acf":{"facebook":"facebook3","twitter":"twitter3"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2e301165-0949-535a-b165-7da2326dbd1d"}}
